# Colorparse v0.0.1

This unoriginal package let's the user generate strings with ansi color escape sequences (which are "*codes*" that tell the terminal what color to display the proceeding characters, and much more: <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>)

Colorparse will simplify the work by reading it's self-defined `color codes` inside the strings (e.g. ";r" will produce the color red).
