## version 1.1.4   (2020 - 03 - 10)
- Re-did regular expression that obtained color codes, now works properly.
- Fixed ``end`` argument of ``paint`` function.
- Now, by default, ``end`` uses ``Color.ENDC`` before the new line character.
- Fixed the white color being the same as light gray (non-true color version).
